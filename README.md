## Installation

### Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a MySQL database named `vehicle_db`. Skip this step if you are using Docker.
3. Create a `app.key` and `app.pub` files in the resources folder. You can generate them using openssl. More info below
   in [OpenSSL](#openssl) section.
4. Run the application using `mvn compile exec:java` or `docker compose up` if you have Docker installed.
5. The application will be running on `http://localhost:9090`.

### OpenSSL

#### Generate a private key

```bash
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out app.key
```

#### Generate a public key

```bash
openssl rsa -pubout -in app.key -out app.pub
```

## Usage

You can find the API documentation in the `src/main/resources/static` folder.
There, you will find the [Vehicles.postman_collection.json](src/main/resources/static/Vehicles.postman_collection.json)
file that contains the Postman collection.
